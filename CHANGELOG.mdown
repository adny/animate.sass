# 0.1.0

* Decided to make a new version away from the original due to breaking changes to the code
* [NEW] Updated to use Sass v3.3 and Compass v1.0, that means it will use the new Compass Cross-Browser Support
* [CHANGED] the animations can be added now using the animations(<animationName/Set>) mixin, just the keyframes using the keyframes-<animationName> or using the mixin directly using animations-<animationName>
* [CHANGED] removed all the gem stuff, as i have no clue about it :P

Keys: [NEW] [CHANGED] [FIXED]
